PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION

Through some process of testing and re-do on the problematic parts during the project: overall of the resulted progress and the final product are as below:

A fully testing of the overall component can’t be done successfully as the compiled programme have been showing a bad result of needing for the ESP8266 to be hard reset; which I have researched on the internet about it was not actually an error and needed to make sure all the component are in good condition. Even if the testing on the system individually like on the vibration and turning systems were successful before being integrated with the other components. It is not really happening anymore which could be because of my fault during the latest installation and the components was not showing any sign of functioning as it supposed to be like before since no blinking light shown. Hence, it could be said that some part of the project were not fully successful which could also be coming from the coding if it really were.

However, there are a few things I was hoping to get rid or reduced off even though mine project was not really successful. Where else, the pulse sensor is supposed to be a wearable device that would not causing any inconvenience to the babies and even no have too long wired system as I have done since it could also lead to tangle the wire around the baby which is another worst scenario. Perhaps, on the other hand; I do think that adding other babies’ monitoring system such as camera, temperature and moisture sensor in the system are the better alternatives idea to finish up on the product building as well creating much more reliable end product
